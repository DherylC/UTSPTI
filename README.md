Welcome to [GAME]! We hope you enjoy your stay.

[GAME] is a simple HTML simulation game that simulates how a person lives in their environment.

Landing page steps:
1. In the landing page, you can choose the character you'd like to be
2. Enter your username (any) and press play.
3. As soon as you hit play, the game timers will go live.

Game Rules:
1. There are 4 bars of status: HP, Hunger, Hygiene, and Mood.
2. Like the human body, all of these statuses will deplete over time, with HP depleting the slowest.
3. When your hunger, hygiene, or mood is depleted (hits zero), your HP will go deplete faster.
4. Move your character using the W, A, S, and D keys or using the arrow buttons available.
5. Everything costs money. You need to earn money in order to survive.
6. You can recover your status by visiting places and doing actions. (ex. Go to the restaurant to eat and recover hunger).
7. Some places are only open at day, and some will only open at night. You need to carefully plan your visits.
8. When HP hits zero, it is game over.
